# AlertR

This app is meant to act as a phone alert.
It is able to be called by external projects, to send notifications to AlertR.
AlertR can then redirect users to custom links, based on what is calling the alarm.

The notifications can be customized, based on severity.
For example, it can act as an actual alarm, if the notification is critical enough.
When setting up AlertR to your infrastructure, you choose which notifications should have which severity settings.
